        <h2>NVF Collections</h2>

        <p>Brands that partner with New Vision Foundation will be asked to design and produce a capsule collection for sale in store in and
        around National Children's Hospice Week (<a href="http://bit.ly/1gC3Fx4">Find out more about Children's Hospice week</a>).<br>
        <br>
        All profits from the sale of these items will go to the foundation creating enormous public awareness of the charities
        involved.<br>
        Not only will this have huge benefits for the Charities involved, but it will also offer Brands significant promotional
        possibilities in showing their charitable support while ticking their CSR policies.</p>

        <h2>POS Donation</h2>

        <p>Giving customers the chance to donate to the foundation at the point of sale. Rather than being asked by the cashier, the
        terminal simply prompts the customer to select a donation amount, round up, or decline to make a donation. The donation is
        processed electronically with the rest of the transaction, providing complete confidentiality.</p>

      <div class="ideas-box col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
        <h2>Payroll Giving</h2>

        <p>Employees of all companies involved will be asked if they would like to donate through their salaries (<a href=
        "http://www.payrollgiving.co.uk">Click here - to find out more about Payroll Giving</a>), a very tax efficient way of supporting
        charity, creating an involvement within the workplace and a "feel good factor" about themselves and their employer.</p>

      <div class="ideas-box col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8">
        <h2>Staff Clothing Donations</h2>

        <p>With the epic rise of the Charity Shop, keeping up with donations has caused problems for many charities. Charities have been
        looking to counteract this issue by requesting many of thier larger corporate supporters host a clothing donation day, whereby the
        corporate supporters employees bring in 1 or more items of clothing to donate to charity.<br>
        This can be done on a monthly, quarterly or half yearly basis and has proved quite successful to the charities currently using this
        method.<br>
        New Vision Foundation can facilitate this process, ensuring the clothing goes to those Charities most in need.</p>
